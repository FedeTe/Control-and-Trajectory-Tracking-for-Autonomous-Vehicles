# Control-and-Trajectory-Tracking-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
## Project Description
In this project it has to be designed a PID controller to perform vehicle trajectory tracking. Given a trajectory as an array of locations, and a simulation environment (the vehicle with possible perturbations), a PID controller has to be designed, coded and tested its efficiency on the CARLA simulator used in the industry.

 * the Behavior Planner
 * the Motion Planner. 
 
 ## Step 1: Build the PID controller object
 Complete the TODO in the pid_controller.h and pid_controller.cpp.
 Here's a screenshot of the CARLA simulator.

 ## Step 2: PID controller for throttle
 ## Step 3: PID controller for steer
 ## Step 4: Evaluate the PID efficiency
